		   lecture
- [ ] Open Slides and Notes de Cours automatically by searching for directory
		a. Add link for files

			- Notes de Cours
			- Liste Exercices
		b. Other Links
			- Website Link

    1. Create a tab file separating the courses material by week for all files
       specified
            a. Add pending for all columns
                * [slides] - green if lecture preparation has been done
                * [lecture] - green if lecture has been watched
                * [review] - green if lecture review has been done
            b. Separe material by weeks
                * set a number of slides to go through per week
                * set unavailable day
                * create a merged bar for row with week
                * add a start date and end date for the session
    2. Create a daily schedule from the weekly separation of all tabs
    3. Open Lecture Notes for the day automatically
